# Civilization Simulation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This project simulates a grid-based civilization environment where multiple "tribes" act as agents to gather resources, grow populations, and expand territory. It supports training with three multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms:

- MAPPO (Multi-Agent PPO)
- QMIX (Value Decomposition for Cooperative Learning)
- Hi-MAPPO (Hierarchical MAPPO with goal-driven planning)

Additionally, a random strategy baseline is included for performance comparison.

## STEPS:

> 1. After cloning/downloading the repo, run *[train_all.py]*
> 2. Verify that the trained model folders exist, then run *[agentCompete.py]*
> 3. For analysis, run *[Analysis.py]*
> 4. For model evaluation, run *[evaluate_all_model.py]*


## 🕹️ Action Space

Each tribe (agent) can choose one of the following actions per step:

- `0`: Harvest – Gather food based on efficiency  
- `1`: Grow – Increase population if enough food is available  
- `2`: Expand – Spread to neighboring cells if population and food requirements are met  

Each episode consists of 10 simulation steps. The goal is to maximize:

- Total population  
- Food reserves  
- Number of occupied grid cells

## 🤖 Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **MAPPO**    | Each agent has an independent actor network and shares a centralized critic; trained via PPO |
| **QMIX**     | Centralized training with decentralized execution using value decomposition |
| **Hi-MAPPO** | A hierarchical approach where a high-level manager selects goals (harvest/grow/expand) and low-level workers execute actions |

Each algorithm supports full training loops, model saving, and reloading.

## 📈 Evaluation

Run the following command to compare all agents' performance:

```bash
python evaluate_all_model.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:
- Grid size (e.g. `5 5`)
- Number of generations (e.g. `1000`)
- Number of initial tribes (e.g. `3`)

The script generates plots comparing:
- Total population and food across methods
- Occupied cell count (territory expansion)
- Output image: `evaluate_all_model_smoothed.png`

---

## 🏁 Training

Run the following script to train the agents:

```bash
python train_all.py
```

The script can be configured to either run in Test or User mode. Test mode uses predetermined values for each parameter as detailed in this README. User mode allows the user to enter their own custom values for each parameter.  

Model save directories:
- `trained_models/` (MAPPO)
- `trained_models_qmix/` (QMIX)
- `trained_models_hi_mappo/` (Hi-MAPPO)

## 💡 Customization Tips

- Modify reward functions in the `_compute_rewards()` method of each `*_env_*.py`
- Add new actions or goals by extending `hi_mappo.py` and the environment
- Tweak network structures and training parameters in `mappo.py`, `qmix.py`, `hi_mappo.py`
- The random strategy may perform relatively well by opportunistically expanding into available cells.
- To improve the performance of learned policies, consider reward shaping or rule-based enhancements to better guide agents toward intended behaviors.
